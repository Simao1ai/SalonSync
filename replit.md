# SalonSync

## Overview

SalonSync is a production-grade, multi-tenant SaaS platform for hair salons. Built as a pnpm monorepo with TypeScript throughout. Features multi-location support, four user roles (Super Admin/Admin/Staff/Client), AI-powered appointment risk scoring, sentiment analysis, an AI receptionist chatbot, analytics, Stripe-ready payments, gift cards, reviews, notifications, and a full platform super-admin interface.

## Design Language

- **Headings**: Playfair Display
- **Body**: DM Sans
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom CSS variables in `index.css`

## Tech Stack

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js**: 24, **TypeScript**: 5.9
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (artifacts/salonsync)
- **Backend**: Express 5 (artifacts/api-server)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (`@workspace/db`)
- **Auth**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) via `@workspace/replit-auth-web`
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude via `@workspace/integrations-anthropic-ai` (Replit-proxied, no API key needed)
- **API contract**: OpenAPI spec → Orval codegen → React Query hooks + Zod schemas
- **Payments**: Stripe UI built, connect account pending

## Frontend Pages

- `/` — Landing page (login redirect if not authenticated)
- `/admin/dashboard` — Admin: stats, recent appointments, risk badges
- `/admin/analytics` — Charts: revenue, appointments, cancellations (Recharts)
- `/staff/dashboard` — Staff: today's schedule, personal stats
- `/client/dashboard` — Client: upcoming appointments, book CTA, gift card balance
- `/client/book` — 4-step booking wizard: service → stylist → time → confirm
- `/admin/:page` — Stub fallback for admin sub-pages

## Key Behaviors

### Cancellation Fee Enforcement
When cancelling within `location.cancellationWindowHours` (default 48h):
- Standard services: 50% of total price charged
- HIGH_VALUE services: 100% of total price charged
- Fee logged to `appointments.cancelFeeCharged`

### AI Risk Scoring
On appointment creation, async POST to `/api/ai/risk-score`:
- Claude analyzes client history + day/time → returns LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
- Score stored on the appointment, shown as colored badges in admin view

### AI Chatbot (SSE)
POST `/api/anthropic/conversations/:id/messages` streams `text/event-stream`:
- Events: `{"type":"text","text":"..."}` chunks, then `{"type":"done"}`
- Frontend uses `use-chat-stream.ts` hook (EventSource/fetch reader)

## Seeded Demo Data

A single location "SalonSync Downtown" (Beverly Hills, CA) with 6 services has been seeded:
- Classic Cut & Style ($85, STANDARD)
- Color Treatment ($225, HIGH_VALUE)
- Balayage ($350, HIGH_VALUE)
- Deep Conditioning ($65, STANDARD)
- Blowout ($55, STANDARD)
- Keratin Smoothing ($400, HIGH_VALUE)

## Codegen

After editing `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`:
```
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen
```
This regenerates both `lib/api-client-react` and `lib/api-zod`.

## DB Schema Push

```
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
```

## TypeScript Project References

Root `tsconfig.json` references all packages. API server depends on `@workspace/db`, `@workspace/api-zod`, `@workspace/integrations-anthropic-ai`, `@workspace/replit-auth-web`. Frontend depends on `@workspace/api-client-react`, `@workspace/replit-auth-web`.

- Stripe payment integration (UI built, connect Stripe account to activate)
- Email notifications via Resend
- Role-based route guards (currently uses `useAuth()` redirect on Landing)
- White-label: apply `primaryColor` to CSS custom properties for full theme customization
